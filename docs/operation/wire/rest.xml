HTTP.  The HTTP layer is only available over SSL (HTTPS), operates on
the IANA assigned port number 43191.  The SSL implementation of the
wire protocol requires client certificates, so this REST mechansim is
only available to HTTP clients that support both SSL and user-supplied
client certificates.  The client certificates must be signed by a
certificate authority recognized by the <command>noitd</command>
